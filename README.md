This was at one time a collection of all my Minetest mods. I was using version 0.4.4 then.

This repository is archivial. The mods have been exported into thier own repos:

- The original [fishing](https://github.com/hildigerr/fishing) mod!
- Various [overriding preferences](https://github.com/hildigerr/minetest_overrides) of my own, as a mod.
- my_mobs remains for archivial purposes, but has also been encorporated into [my fork of mobs](https://github.com/hildigerr/mobs).
